# CMPT 496 Capstone project

This game was created by a team of four students from MacEwan University who worked on this project from September 2023 - December 2023 under the advisement of Dr. Candy Pang. It is a partnership with the Edmonton Public Library for their Digital Experience Wall!

Bug Snatch, our game, was created to appeal to a wide demographic. The objective of the game is to catch as many bugs as you can in 45 seconds as they crawl across the screen. At the end of the gameplay, you can get an overview of the bugs you've caught as well as learn a fact or two about them.

The game is touch-responsive and was developed using the Unity game engine as well as the TouchScript library. As such, the game can be played alone or alongside others!

Happy bug snatching!
